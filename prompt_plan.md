REMCOM MVP Build Blueprint
This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step blueprint for building the REMCOM MVP project, starting with a structured development plan, followed by an iterative breakdown of implementation chunks. Each chunk is further decomposed into test-driven, developer-ready prompt blocks that ensure best practices, early testing, and safe integration.
