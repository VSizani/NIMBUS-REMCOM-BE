# REMCOM MVP Build Blueprint

This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step blueprint for building the REMCOM MVP project, starting with a structured development plan, followed by an iterative breakdown of implementation chunks. Each chunk is further decomposed into test-driven, developer-ready prompt blocks that ensure best practices, early testing, and safe integration.

---

## I. High-Level Development Plan

### Requirements Finalization

* Confirm and freeze all functional and non-functional requirements.
* Review all user roles and permissions.

### Architecture Design

* Choose tech stack (e.g., React + Node.js + PostgreSQL).
* Define layered architecture: UI, API, Service, Repository.
* Set up CI/CD, environment configs, and deployment strategy.

### Core Modules Design

* **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure login and role-based access.
* **Manual Entry & Lookup**: Provide lookup for drivers and vehicles.
* **Action Interface**: Enable execution of WoA and payment marking.
* **PDF Generation**: Generate PDF documents for actions.
* **XML Export**: Export data to XML format for reconciliation.
* **Admin Reconciliation**: Upload and match XML files to DB.
* **Audit Trail**: Persist and query user actions for transparency.

### Testing & QA

* Define testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end).
* Set up Jest/Cypress (or equivalents).

### Deployment & Monitoring

* Set up production build & test automation.
* Enable monitoring, logging, and alerting for system health.
